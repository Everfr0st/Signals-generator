This is a project of the course microprocessors by Univerisdad Autonoma de Occidente.
In this project you'll find the way of creating a signal generator using artificial signals, also, using the AVR architecture and Assembly language.
For testing you can use te files .pdsprj, you can find them on the folder "Proteus", just double click on the ATMEGA2560 and charge the file .hex that ypu can 
find in the next path: "Lab1_x_/Lab1_x/debug/Lab1_x.hex"
